The theme here is Cascade: [https://github.com/cascadefox/cascade](https://github.com/cascadefox/cascade)
That was the old theme, this is the new theme: [minimal-functional-fox](https://github.com/mut-ex/minimal-functional-fox)

I could fetch the theme, but then I don't know how to edit it, so I just cloned the repo and moved the Firefox chrome here.
